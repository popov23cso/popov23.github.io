            I`ve come to the realisation that every problem has a solution and programming languages<br>
            are the tool that helps solve it.

                        C taught me the principles of programming.

                        Using Python, I learned about back-end technologies, web scraping
                        and the amazing concept of using lower-level languages to solve algorithmic
                        problems and calling them from the higher-level language for maximum performance.

                        I used JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and fetch data from API`s.
                        That ensured smooth and enjoyable experience for the end user.
