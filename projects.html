            Project name - Dungeon Crawl
        </h1>
        <h2>
            A short game that follows the classic dungeon crawl formula.

            I created this project as a way to learn the basics of object-oriented programming.
        </h4>
        <p>
            I wrote the first iteration of the project in C++ and later rewrote it in Java.
            It is a text-based game in which the player character enters a dungeon and after
            each successful clearing of a floor, advances a floor down. Along their journey, they
            can encounter unfriendly foes, stumble upon random loot, or visit a merchant that exchanges
            their wares for gold. At the end of the dungeon, the player fights a final boss. The game
            itself is not perfectly balanced gameplay-wise, but the purpose of the project is to create
            a foundation that can be expanded upon to create more classes using inheritance and make
            the gameplay more diverse.
